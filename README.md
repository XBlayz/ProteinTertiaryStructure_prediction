# Protein tertiary structure prediction
This is an academic _project_ about creating a C algorithm for **predicting protein tertiary structure** based on their sequence.
The object of this _project_ is to optimize the code with some **assembly procedures** using **SSE** and **AVX** instructions.

## Algorithm definition
The **algorithm** is defined in the _doc file_ that describes the project.
